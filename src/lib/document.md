# included random stuff library documentation
okie
### its not working
try harder
im not fixing anything unless i need to
### the lib loader specifically isnt working
this is an issue with the code most likely, i have tested nothing at the time of writing
### some libraries are unavailable
refer to lib loader section
### it crashed when i used a function
most of these work outside of the game, you could test from there to find the issue and fix it yourself on the repo
